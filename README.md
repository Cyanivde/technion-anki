# Anki decks for Technion

To get started, download [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), then import any of the [decks](https://github.com/Cyanivde/technion-anki/tree/main/Decks).


## What is Anki?
Anki is a flashcards app that helps students efficiently memorize things.

Each card has a "question" side and an "answer" side. After reviewing a card, you mark how well you remember it, and it will show up again in an appropriate amount of time.
